## Aim
Success of any educational institution lies in identifying the potential of its students. The institution lacked a digital system to collect and analyze student details.
RoSAT (RNSIT Online Scholastic Assessment Test) was developed with the aim to collect details of the students including but not limited to their academic and extra-curricular activities and their achievements and to evaluate students using a scholastic ability test. The information collected and the test scores will be used to classify students as fast learners, average learners and slow learners.
The test is to measure a student's scholastic ability and achievements. ROSAT will measure the analytical skills, problem solving ability, literary and writing skills that are needed for academic success in college. The SAT assesses how well the test takers analyze and solve problems â€” skills they learned in school that they will need in college. The test is administered under a tight time limit (speeded) to help produce a range of scores.
RoSAT will also be used to provide students with opportunities not limited to internships and jobs based on their skill set.
